REPRESENTATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDMENTS
| comply with the definition of an "Issuance Representor", as set out in Clause 1 of this Deed,
in relation to the Project.
| hereby represent and warrant that:
2.2,1 The Monitoring Report and any other Project Documents for which | am responsible
and am supplying to a VCS Registry are true and accurate in all material respects;
2.2.2 | have the right to all and any Reductions generated by the Project during the
Verification Period; and
2.3
2.4
2.5
v3.3
2.2.3 | have not submitted, sought, requested or received any recognition of the Reductions
generated by the Project during the Verification Period and for which | am requesting
VCU issuance from any GHG Program other than under the VCS Program or as any
other form of GHG- or renewable energy-related environmental credit (including
without limitation as renewable energy certificates), or | have provided evidence to
the VCS Registry in accordance with the VCS Rules that any such credits have not
been used and have been cancelled under the relevant environmental credit program.
| hereby acknowledge that a VCS Registry shall hold this Deed for the benefit. of
Accountholders holding VCUs relating to the Project at any given time.
| hereby acknowledge that the VCSA:
2.4.1 Reserves the right to take action against an Issuance Representor where the VCSA
deems, acting reasonably, that there has been a material erroneous issuance of
VCUs in respect of the Project, as a result of the fraudulent conduct, negligence,
intentional act, recklessness, misrepresentation or mistake of the Issuance
Representor; and
2.4.2 Will determine such action having regard to the VCS Rules, Such action may include:
(a) Directing a VCS Registry to cancel erroneously issued VCUs;
(b) Requiring the Issuance Representor to cancel erroneously issued VCUs held
in its VCS Registry account;
(ce) Requiring the Issuance Representor to replace an equivalent number of
VCUs from subsequent issuances of VCUs to the Project;
(d) Requiring the Issuance Representor to purchase and cancel an equivalent
number of replacement VCUs; or
(e) Where the Issuance Representor or Project Proponent fails to compensate
for the erroneous issuance of the VCUs, other action including without
limitation the application of restrictions to the registry account activities of the
Issuance Representor or Project Proponent until the compensation has been
provided.
The VCSA will use reasonable efforts to work with the Issuance Representor to ensure that
any adverse impacts on the Project Proponent of actions taken under this Clause 2.4 are
minimised to the extent possible.
| further acknowledge that any action under Clause 2.4 may be commenced by the VOSA
only in relation to VCUs for which the Verification Report is published on or after 8 April 2014
and up to the later of:
{a) 6 years after the date of issuance of the VCU referred to in Clause 2.4; or
(b) 12 months after the date upon which any second verification report with respect to the
erroneously issued VCU is accepted on the VCS registry system.”
The intention is that a VCU will be issued following acceptance of the Verification Report for the Project. For
some types of AFOLU projects in particular, the verification cycle may be longer than 6 years. In this regard,
if the second verification report shows a VCU has been erroneously issued the VCSA will have an additional
12 months to deal with that issue. Note also that where a VCU is erroneously issued from the last verification
report of the Project, Clause 2,5(a) applies
2.6

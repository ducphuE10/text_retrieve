Gold Standard for the Global Goals
PoA Design Consultation Report



July 2017, Version 1

SECTION A. 		PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION

A. 1. 	Title and purpose of the Programme 

	>> Provide brief technical description of the programme and key objectives
	Name: Waste management PoA in India
	Date: 26/12/2019
Version: 1
The PoA is an umbrella carbon offset programme designed for organisations in the waste management sector. The programme aims to address issues of asymmetries of participation, especially for small-scale project partners in key community-oriented areas and sectors in multiple cities across India.  The programme seeks to divert MSW away from landfills and other SWDSs and instead process it through several technologies including composting and waste to energy (biogas) technologies thus avoiding methane emissions from landfills. The project will be registered with the Gold Standard for Global Goals to claim emission reductions. GIZ-India as part of Global Carbon Market project is sensitizing green startups and social enterprises to access voluntary carbon markets that also led to linking of some of the enterprises included in the PoA with Value Network Ventures Advisory Services Pte. Ltd.
This waste is processed through various technologies including

    (I) Compost from MSW
    (II) Bio gas for thermal applications
    (III) Biogas for electricity generation
    (IV) Bio-CNG for transport application



The PoA covers the following scopes:

    (i) Avoidance of methane emissions
    (ii) Methane Production and Recovery 
    (iii) Displacement of fossil fuels
    (iv) Displacement of electricity from the grid

The purpose of the PoA is to enable waste management organisations to manage and scale up operations through carbon revenues. The technologies used include

    1. Composting of organic wastes
    2. Biogas for Thermal Applications
    3. Bio-CNG for transport applications
    4. Biogas for Electricity Generation

 

Composting

The PoA includes technologies that process the organic component of Municipal Solid Waste and convert it to compost, which is used for soil application.

The composting units or facilities vary in size and technology among VPAs. The size of the units varies depending on the requirement of the end user and can range from the completely decentralised (such as at a household level) to more centralised, larger units. 

The project activity seeks to divert the organic component of MSW away from landfills of=r other SWDSs, thereby reducing methane emissions. In addition, distance of transport of the waste is reduced. The compost produced is used for soil application, thereby reducing the usage of synthetic fertilisers for the same. 

The size and technical specifications of the units/facilities will be elaborated on in the respective VPA DD.

Biogas for Thermal Applications

The organic component of MSW are processed under anaerobic conditions in a biodigestor, and the resulting methane is captured and used for thermal applications, such as cooking. The composition of the substrate (MSW) can vary among and between VPAs. In some instances, the substrate could be composed of MSW mixed with small quantities of animal wastes. 

The biogas produced is used for thermal applications in households, communities, institutions and commercial establishments. The biogas produced is either piped directly or bottled and distributed.

The project activity seeks to divert MSW from landfills or other SWDSs and hence avoid methane emissions. In addition, the biogas produced replaces fossil fuels such as LPG or PNG that would have been used in the absence of the project.


Bio-CNG for Transport Applications

The organic component of MSW is processed at a centralised plant to produce bio-gas. The gas produced is purified to eliminate contaminants such as Hydrogen Sulphide, water and CO2, and compressed. The purified gas contains around 95% methane. This is either bottled and supplied to vehicles, or is used at a filling station. 

The project activity seeks to divert MSW from landfills or other SWDSs and hence avoid methane emissions. In addition, the biogas produced replaces fossil fuels such as diesel or petrol, that would have been used in the absence of the project.

Biogas for Electricity Generation

The organic component of MSW are processed under anaerobic conditions in a biodigestor, and the resulting methane is used for electricity generation. The composition of the substrate (MSW) can vary among and between VPAs. In some instances, the substrate could be composed of MSW mixed with small quantities of animal wastes. 

The biogas produced is used for electricity generation and captive consumption in communities, institutions and commercial establishments.

The project activity seeks to divert MSW from landfills or other SWDSs and hence avoid methane emissions. In addition, the biogas produced replaces electricity from a regional or national grid that would have been used in the absence of the project.

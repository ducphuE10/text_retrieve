1  PROJECT DETAILS
1.1  Summary Description of the Project
Masat Enerji Elektrik Üretim ve Tic. Ltd. Şti. is to construct a 32.55 MWe capacity Hydroelectric
Power plant. Midilli Hydroelectric Power Plant (Midilli HPP in short) is a project that is designed
and planned to be constructed on Yeşilırmak river , Amasya Turkey. Yeşilırmak River, is one of
the biggest rivers in Turkey, and gives its name to the Yeşilırmak basin that makes up one of the
26 big river catchments of Turkey. The purpose of the project is to supply electricity to the Turkish
power grid, from a renewable source.
The Project Activity (PA) utilizes the Yeşilırmak river water in a diversion-type run-of-river hydro
power scheme to generate electricity with zero carbon emissions for the Turkish Power Grid. The
PA will be displacing electricity that would otherwise be generated by the existing grid of the host
country. Annual gross electricity production by the PA is estimated to be 124,050  MWh1.
Therefore the Project Activity is expected to lead to an emission reduction of 63,7612 tonnes CO
The environmental impacts of the project is kept to a minimum level and all the regulations that
are in act in the host country, Turkey, are obeyed during the construction and operation stages of
the Midilli HPP project. At the planning stage these impacts have been investigated and were
presented to the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning (MoEUP), in the form of a Project
Introductory File (PIF). The provincial directorate of MoEUP in Amasya province examined the
report, and the project was granted an EIA not Necessary certification. Considering that the
project will be using the water resource that is also essential for the aquatic life in the area, there
is a fish ladder (fish passage way) within the regulator for the downstream and upstream
movement of the fish, to facilitate fish migration.
The, project owner Masat Enerji  Elektrik Üretim ve Tic. Ltd. Şti., also owns an Hydro Power
plant, namely the 22.5 MW capacity Yavuz HPP at the downstream of the project activity, and
initially the two projects were developed together, however, it was not possible to benefit from
carbon finance at the time of initial project development as the knowhow at the project owner side
and the host country was limited at the time of early project development compared to the time
when this PDD is being prepared. Initially for the two project the project owner signed a loan
contract, but utilized the entire amount prior to the construction of Midilli HPP, for the Yavuz HPP
Project and then they applied for another finance source as the project costs have increased
significantly, and there were not many resource left for the Midilli HPP.  Signing of the first loan is
considered as the investment decision date for the Midilli HPP. Accordingly the Major milestones
at the project development history can be summarized as shown in the following table (Table 1):

1.8  Description of the Project Activity
The Project Activity is comprised of the following main parts: a diversion weir to divert the water, a
channel connected by two conveyance tunnels and the powerhouse where the turbines are
housed. Water will be collected by a controlled weir. The weir will also include two spillway gates,
a spill water crest and a fish gate on the left bank. Water will enter the weir from an intake
structure and leave the weir from the outlet gates into a 13,435 m conveyance tunnel-channel
system. The water will then pass to the turbines via a surge tank and a penstock of 230 m. A
gross head of 152 m will be formed (net head 132.14 m) and water will be discharged into four
Francis turbines, which are contained within the powerhouse. The electricity will be transmitted
via 34.5 kV transmission lines through Yenidere Havza transformer substations, via 11 km

combined margin emmission factor calculated on section 3 of this document.
transmission line. The Project Activity will implement the best available technology and
management standards.
To summarize the technical description of the Project Activity, the main technical characteristics
obtained from final revised and DSİ approved feasibility report  and latest information based on
the final water usage agreement of the Project Activity and its general properties of the facilities
are provided below (Table 2):
Table 2:General properties of the project facilities
Total Production Hours (h)
Dam Voltage (kV)  3 x 10.6 kV; 1 x 6.3 kV
Energy Transmission Line Section  33 kV
Energy Transmission Line Length (km)  11 km
The project will be using Four Francis type turbines. The working principle of the Francis turbine
is such that the water coming from the penstock is transferred to the inlet scroll, which distributes
the water equally around the wicket gates. Water passes through the wicket gates, which controls
the amount of water passing through the turbine, before reaching the runner. This in effect
controls the power output of the hydroelectric power plant. The wicket gates also adjust the angle
of the water reaching to the runner. After passing through the wicket gates, the water reaches the
runner. The water pressure forces the runner to rotate. The rotation speed of the runner can be in
the range of 80 to 1000 revolutions per minute. The water continues its motion downward under
the runner to the exit pipe. The exit pipe discharges the water to the environment as low pressure
water. The rotational motion of the runner is transferred to an electric generator. The generated
electricity is converted to a high voltage current and is transferred to the grid to be consumed..
The following figure exhibits the working principle of a Vertical axis Francis Turbine (Figure 4):
Figure 2: The working principle of a Francis type turbine.
The project owner is granted a production license for 49 years  The economic life time of a hydro
power plant investment is assumed to be about 50 years, based on the experts’ committee report
on energy under the 8th development plan published by the State planning organization. Even if
the facility can last for 50 years the major equipment needs to be replaced in every 20 years .
The project is expected to produce 124,050 MWh of electricity per year, over the first crediting
period. The annual electricity delivered to the grid by the project, would have otherwise been
generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation
sources. Based on this a combined margin emission reduction factor is calculated as detailed
below in Chapter 3 of this document.

2  APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
2.1  Title and Reference of Methodology
Approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 “Large-scale
Consolidated Methodology; Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources.”
Version 14.0.0.
The Approved Methodology refers to the following tools:
“Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 07.0.0; EB 70 -Annex 8 )
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. (Version 04.0.0;EB 75-Annex 15)
"Guidelines on the assessment of investment analysis” (Version 5; EB62-Annex 5)
2.2  Applicability of Methodology
The ACM0002 (version 14.0.0) methodology is applicable to grid-connected renewable power
generation project activities that: (a) install a new power plant at a site where no renewable power
plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity (greenfield plant); (b) involve
a capacity addition; (c) involve a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s); or (d) involve a replacement of
(an) existing plant(s).
The choice of methodology ACM0002, Version 14.0.0, is justified as the project activity meets the
following applicability criteria:
7 The reservoir volume Area curve that indicates the aerial extent of the reservoir at maximum operation level is provided in Annex 5.
8  This requirement can be demonstrated, for example: (i) by the fact that water flow from upstream power units spilling directly to
the downstream reservoir; or (ii) through the analysis of the water balance. Water balance is the mass balance of water fed to
power units, with all possible combinations of multiple reservoirs and without the construction of reservoirs. The purpose of such
water balance is to demonstrate the requirement of specific combination of multiple reservoirs constructed under CDM project
activity for the optimization of power output. This demonstration has to be carried out in the specific scenario of water availability
in different seasons to optimize the water flow at the inlet of power units. Therefore this water balance will take into account
seasonal flows from river, tributaries (if any), and rainfall for minimum three years prior to implementation of CDM project activity.
9  The ACM002 (version 13.0.0) indicates that “…project participants wishing to undertake a hydroelectric project activity that result
in a new reservoir or an increase in the existing reservoir, in particular where reservoirs have no significant vegetative biomass in
the catchments area, may request a revision to the approved consolidated methodology”.. ;In the case of the project activity as
the power density is greater than 4 W/m2, there is no need for such a claim or revision request. .
2.3  Project Boundary
baseline but the project activity does not emit any of the gases listed, in Table 4.
The project boundary includes net electricity generated and supplied to the Turkish national grid.
Table 3: Main gases included in the project boundary
2.4  Baseline Scenario
Since the proposed project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected hydroelectric, that is
renewable power plant and therefore, the baseline scenario is defined as the following based on
ACM0002 (Version 14.0.0):
“Electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by
the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as
reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the. Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system (v.03.0.0; EB 70-Annex 22).”
Since the proposed project activity is going to be connected to the Turkish national grid, the
baseline scenario of the proposed project is the supply of the equivalent amount of annual power
output by the existing Turkish national grid which is the continued operation of existing power
plants and the addition of new sources to meet electricity demand.
Based on ACM002, baseline emissions are equal to power generated by the project activity that
is delivered to the Turkish national grid, multiplied by the baseline emissions factor. This baseline
emissions factor (EFy) is calculated as the Combined Margin (CM), of which the breakdown and
detailed description is given below in chapter 3.
2.5  Additionality
The proposed project activity reduces GHG emissions by substituting fossil fuel based electricity
generation by renewable resources (hydro) based electricity generation.
This part refers to the “Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality Version 7.0.0”
and the numbering in this section reflects the Tool’s Guidelines provided at EB 70, Annex 8.
Step 1 - Identification of Alternatives to the project activity consistent with current laws
and regulations
Sub-step 1a - Define alternatives to the project activity:
The tool notifies that “Project activities that apply this tool in context of approved consolidated
methodology ACM0002, only need to identify that there is at least one credible and feasible
alternative that would be more attractive than the proposed project activity.”
The project alternative can be defined as follows:
Continuation of the current situation (No project activity or other alternatives undertaken). This
alternative is the most likely scenario, since there are no legal obligation to implement such a
project and without VCS support the project implementation is financially not attractive.
Outcome of Step 1a: The only realistic and credible alternative scenario to the project activity is
Continuation of the current situation, without any project undertaken .
Sub-step 1b. Consistency with mandatory laws and regulations:
The project alternative, the baseline scenario, which is the continuation of the existing situation, is
in compliance with all mandatory applicable and legal and regulatory requirements. Also the
alternative scenario of addition of a new power generation capacity to the grid is regulated by
Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) who issues the licenses for electricity generation
and is responsible for ensuring that new capacity applies with its rules and regulations. The list of
the rules and regulations of the host country that a new electricity generation project has to
comply with is given in Annex 1.
Outcome of Step 1b: The alternative scenario to the project activity is the supply of electricity by
the existing grid with additional capacity is in compliance with mandatory legislation and
Step 2 - Investment analysis
At this step it will be demonstrated that “the proposed project activity is not the most economically
or financially attractive" option. Please note that, at this step, the “Guidelines on the assessment
of investment analysis” (EB 62 Report Annex 5) Version 05 is followed.
Sub-step 2a - Determine appropriate analysis method
There are three options for investment analysis method:
•  Simple Cost Analysis
•  Investment Comparison Analysis and
•  Benchmark Analysis
“Simple Cost Analysis” is not applicable for this project activity as the project generates economic
benefits from sale of electricity to the Turkish national grid”. Investment Comparison Analysis is
also eliminated since the baseline for the project is “the generation of electricity by the existing
grid” and no similar investment alternatives exist. Therefore, Benchmark Analysis is the most
appropriate approach for the evaluation of the project activity.
Sub-step 2b - Option III-Apply benchmark analysis
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on equity is taken for this project to be the financial indicator for
assessing the financial viability of the project activity..
Equity IRR is the cash flow return to equity shareholders after debt repayments. And therefore
also takes into account the debt repayments. Equity IRR takes into consideration that you use
debt for the project, so the inflows are the cash flows required minus any debt that was raised for
the project. The outflows are cash flows from the project minus any interest and debt repayments.
To be able to assess the financial viability of the project a benchmark to compare the equity IRR
is needed.
The Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality Version 7.0.0 (EB 70, Annex 8)
and the Guidelines issued at EB 62 state that “...Discount rates and benchmarks shall be derived
from: Government bond rates, increased by a suitable risk premium to reflect private investment
and/or the project type, as substantiated by an independent (financial) expert or documented by
official publicly available financial data”
The Guidelines issued at EB 6210, provides the default values for the expected return on equity as
an appendix, and Moody’s index values of most of the CDM Countries. At the time of investment
decision (2007 see table 1), Turkey’s Moody’s index (Ba3-Stable11 between 2005 to 2009) was
comparable to country’s with the same Moody’s index, and same default benchmark value from
this point of view a rreasonable and appropriate benchmark to compare the Equity IRR can be
taken as 12.75 %.
Sub-step 2c - Calculation and comparison of financial indicators
The following parameters are taken into account for the assessment of the investment (Table 5)
and supplementary parameters are provided in the “MidilliFinancialAnalysis” workbook and
submitted to the validating DOE.

number 5346
The value of the investment has been depreciated on a reducing balance basis over 20 years, 75
% of the long lasting assets are depreciated over 45 years and the residual book value of
23,527,547.55 USD is added back to the cash flow.  The economic life time of a hydro power
plant investment is assumed to be about 50 years, based on the experts’ committee report12 on
energy under the 8th development plan published by the State planning organization. Even if the
facility can last for 50 years the major equipment needs to be replaced in every 20 years13. As a
result the project lifetime is estimated to be about 20 years and the investment analysis is
therefore done for a time frame of 20 years.
For the assessment of the viability of the project activity the Equity IRR is compared to the
benchmark. The equity IRR is worked out as 10.32 %, which is below the benchmark of 12.50%.
Sub-step 2d - Sensitivity Analysis
To be able to conclude if the investment decision is the financially the most attractive alternative
or not, a sensitivity analysis is performed. Three parameters that affect the equity IRR are
examined for the sensitivity analysis:
•  Investment Cost
•  Operating and Maintenance Cost
•  Electricity Revenue
12 http://ekutup.dpt.gov.tr/enerji/oik585.pdf page 4.25 (Last visited on 3/3/2011)
13 http://ekutup.dpt.gov.tr/enerji/oik585.pdf page 4.26 (Last visited on 3/3/2011)
The sensitivity analysis is performed for a range of ±10% fluctuations in the above parameters.
The figures in the following table (Table 6) are obtained. Following the "Guidelines on the
assessment of investment analysis (Version 05)" of EB 62 Annex 5 when any of the key variables
are increased or decreased by at least 10%, and the benchmark is not exceeded (also see Figure
Table 5: Sensitivity analysis for the Equity IRR without carbon revenue for the project (Benchmark:
Figure 4: Sensitivity analysis: Fluctuation of the Equity IRR without the carbon revenue, by
changing major parameters that effect the Equity IRR by ±10%
To exceed the benchmark, the electricity revenue must increase by about 18.70 % over the life of
the project, or the investment cost must be reduced by about 11.13 %. The Renewable energy
law only guaranties a minimum price of USD 0.073 per kWh for renewable energy and the price ,
and the price that was announced at the EMRA web site was approximately 6.4 US cents14,,
indicating that our estimation for the renewable energy price was reasonable. However, we do not
expect an increase in the electricity revenue related to a price increase and since the feasibility
report and the design of the project is based on the maximum available capacity of the Yeşilırmak
river, and since our entire financial analysis is based on the maximum net electricity output of the
project, such an increase based on an increased amount of electricity generation is very unlikely.
In addition to that as the availability of the water decreases due to the globally accepted results of
global climate change, electricity production is very unlikely to reach to an increased generation
amount of an additional 18.70 %. In addition to this the climate change models indicate for the
14 The officially announced price for the time of investment decision was 9.67 ykrs/ kWh this converts to approximately 6.4 Dolar
Cents. http://www.epdk.gov.tr/documents/elektrik/mevzuat/kurul_karar/elektrik/Elk_Tarife_Top_Sts_Tetas_2007.zip
Mediterranean basin an increased drought and water scarcity that could even risk the project to
reach the firm energy values.
The investment costs we have considered in our financial analysis was based on the third party
prepared revised feasibility report that was available to the project owner at the time of
investment decision. Therefore these numbers are reasonable and reflect the average market
conditions but are unlikely to go down, as the focus of the project developer is to secure and
improve the electricity yield and therefore they will not be able to cut costs. Therefore it is very
unlikely for the investment cost to finalize below the amounts estimated and shown in the
financial analysis.
Outcome of Step 2:
Without the VER revenue the Internal Rate of Return of the project cannot get close to the
benchmark of 12.50 %, with an equity internal rate of return of 10.32%. A fluctuation of ± 10% in
the key parameters also does not make the project exceed the benchmark.
Step 3 - Barrier Analysis
As the investment analysis concludes that the proposed project activity is unlikely to be the most
financially attractive option, the sub step 3- Barrier analysis is optional to be applied and barrier
analysis is not considered for the Midilli HPP.
Step 4: Common Practice Analysis
Sub-step 4a. Analyse other activities similar to the proposed project activity
As per “Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality”, projects are considered
similar if they are in the same country/region and/or rely on a broadly similar technology, are of a
similar scale, and take place in a comparable environment with respect to regulatory frame-work,
investment climate, access to technology, access to financing, etc. Although the tool does not
consider the Sectoral Scope 1: Energy industries (renewable-/non -renewable sources) projects
amongst the measures that can make use of the common practice guideline version 02, we
preferred to utilise the same guideline to demonstrate that within the boundaries of the Yeşilırmak
catchment (see Figure 5 for the borders of the differentiated geographical region) there are no
similar projects that are developed and operational without the assistance of the VER revenue.
According to the Guidelines on Common Practice (version 02), common practice analysis is
presented through the following 4 steps.
Common Practice tool Step 1: Calculate applicable output range as +/-50% of the design output
or capacity of the proposed project activity:
As a hydropower project, the installed capacity is chosen as an appropriate proxy for “similar
scale”. The power generation capacity of 32.548 MW of the proposed project is selected as the
design capacity. Therefore, the range from 16.274 to  48.82 MW is considered as applicable
Outcome of Step 1: Applicable output range is 16.274 MW to 48.82 MW.
Common Practice tool Step 2: identify similar projects (both CDM and non-CDM) which fulfil all of
the following conditions:
(a) The projects are located in the applicable geographical area;
(b) The projects apply the same measure as the proposed project activity;
(c) The projects use the same energy source/fuel and feedstock as the proposed project activity,
if a technology switch measure is implemented by the proposed project activity;
(d) The plants in which the projects are implemented produce goods or services with comparable
quality, properties and applications areas (e.g. clinker) as the proposed project plant;
(e) The capacity or output of the projects is within the applicable capacity or output range
calculated in Step 1;
(f) The projects started commercial operation before the project design document (CDM-PDD) is
published for global stakeholder consultation or before the start date of proposed project activity,
whichever is earlier for the proposed project activity15.
The host country is geographically divided into 25 catchments as shown in the following figure
(Figure 5). As can be seen from the figure the project site is located within the borders of the
Yeşilırmak Catchment. Yeşilırmak and its major tributary Kelkit River constitute the Yeşilırmak
River Catchment. Therefore we have considered the geographical boundary of our common
practice analysis as the Yeşilırmak Catchment, and we have checked the hydropower plants that
are operational, within the range defined in step 1 (16.274 MW to 48.82 MW) and located on the
Kelkit or Yeşilırmak Rivers. These are listed on Table 6:

Outcome of Step 2:
There are 9 projects within the comparison range of the project activity.
Step 3: within the projects identified in Step 2, identify those that are neither registered CDM
project activities, project activities submitted for registration, nor project activities undergoing
validation. Note their number N .
The above list covers all the power plants within the geographical boundary defined above (as
Yeşilırmak River Catchment). Checking all the power plants within the capacity range determined
in Step 1, and looking projects that have started commercial operation before the start date of the
project, and eliminating the ones that do claim VER credits, we end up with the following table
(Table 7):

Step 4: within similar projects identified in Step 3, identify those that apply technologies that are
different to the technology applied in the proposed project activity. Note their number N .
When we consider the project listed in Step 3, the projects differ from the project activity by the
following aspects:
Çamlıgöze HPP and Almus Dam are developed by the government so they were developed in a
different economic setting or with different motivations:
Yavuz HPP is a private owned project, that was developed by private sector, however the project
activity was designed by DSI and was later auctioned and Masat Enerji  Elektrik Üretim ve Tic.
Ltd. Şti. (Which is also the owner of the project activity that is subject to this Project Description
Document) the present project owner won the auction.  At the time the Yavuz HPP was
developed the project owner was not aware of Carbon finance and the leverage it brings to their
projects. On the other hand, we know by the project investment expenditure data filed by the
same owner that, it is revealed that the unit cost (cost per MW) of Yavuz has 68 % less than that
of Midilli HPP therefore this project is also considered to be different than the project activity.

2.6  Methodology Deviations
The UNFCCC methodology of ACM0002/ Version 14.0.0 and its related tools have been applied
without many deviations.
With the exception of the below Monitoring parameter :
The rational for this can be explained as follows:
Although the methodology (ACM002, v.14.0.0) requires reservoir area to be monitored, since the
power density of the project activity is very large, and the area flooded due to the project activity
cannot exceed the above given amount (26,000 m2; See also Annex-5: The Map Showing the
Reservoir Area of the Project Activity on page 75), the parameter related to the reservoir area is
not going to be monitored during the crediting period for Midilli HPP Project.
3  QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1  Baseline Emissions
According to the latest version (version 14.0.0) of ACM0002 and the tool to calculate the emission
factor for electricity system, since the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected
renewable power plant/unit, the baseline scenario is the following:
otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power
plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate
the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 04.0.0 (EB 75,
Annex 15)).
The Project therefore applies the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 04.0.0 (EB 75, Annex 15)).
Step 1 -Identify the relevant electricity systems
As the host country is not participating in the compliance markets hence does not have a DNA, a
delineation of the project electricity system and connected electricity systems has not been
published yet. For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the
existence of significant transmission constraints:
1.  “In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity
prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems
during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.” This criteria is not applicable as there is no
spot electricity market in the host country.
2.  “The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or
more of the hours of the year”: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source
has not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be
According to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid
boundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems
(e.g. provincial / regional / national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many
cases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,
directly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)
grid definition should be used by default.
Therefore, for the case of the subject project activity “the project electricity system” and “the
connected system” are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the “project electricity
system”. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn’t any
independent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity
Grid is given in the below figure (Figure 7):
Figure 6: The Map showing the boundaries of Turkish Electricity Grid  (Source Electricity Market
Report 2010, by Electricity Market Regulatory Authority
All the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.
For the purpose of determining the operating margin emission factor, the tool directs us to use
one of the following options to determine the CO2 emission factor(s) for net electricity imports
from a connected electricity system:
(a) 0 t CO2/MWh; or
(b) The simple operating margin emission rate of the exporting grid, determined as described in
Step 4 section 6.4.1, if the conditions for this method, as described in Step 3 below, apply to the
exporting grid; or
(c) The simple adjusted operating margin emission rate of the exporting grid, determined as
described in Step 4 section 6.4.2 below; or
(d) The weighted average operating margin (OM) emission rate of the exporting grid, determined
as described in Step 4 section 6.4.4 below.
For imports from connected electricity systems located in Annex I country(ies), the emission
factor is 0 tons CO  per MWh.
And the tool also notes that the …”Electricity exports should not be subtracted from electricity
generation data used for calculating and monitoring the electricity emission factors.”
In our case the host country (imports electricity mainly from Annex -1 countries, so the emission
factor related to imports is considered to be zero”0”.
Step 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system
The tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the
operating margin and build margin emission factor:
Option I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.
Option II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.
In our case, “Option I” has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid
power plants are included in the calculation.
Step 3 – Select an operating margin (OM) method
According to the  “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟, version 03.0.0 in
calculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EF ), project
grid,OM, y
developers have the option of selecting from four methods:
(a) Simple OM,
(b) Simple adjusted OM,
(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or
(d) Average OM.
As the share of “low cost/must run” resources are below 50% for the five most recent years
(Table 8), therefore, in accordance with the Tool, (a) Simple OM method will be used in the
Table 8: Share of primary sources in electricity generation, 2008 – 201218
Wind &
Geothermal  2.36%
Since the Simple OM calculation (option (A)) is selected, the emission factor is calculated by the
generation-weighted average emissions per electricity unit (tCO /GWh), and averaged over the
past three years of all generating sources serving the system, not including low-cost / must run
power plants. The tool gives two options for the calculation of EF ;
grid, OM, y
•  Ex-ante option
A 3-year generation-weighted average, based on the most recent data available at the time of
submission of the VER-PDD to the DOE for validation, without the requirement to monitor and
recalculate the emissions factor during the crediting period, or
•  Ex-post option
The year in which the project activity displaces grid electricity, with the requirement that the
emission factor be updated annually during monitoring.
18 Annual Development of Installed Capacity Generation in Turkey (1970-2012)
For the calculation of the Simple OM, the “Ex-Ante” option is selected, at the time of PDD
submission to the DOE, the data vintages that were most recent at the start of validation, belongs
to the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. All the data used in calculation of the Simple OM are taken
from the TEIAS website, details of which are given below.
Step 4 - Calculate the operating margin emission factor according to the selected method
The Simple OM emission factor is calculated as the generation-weighted average CO  emissions
per unit of net electricity generation (tCO /MWh) for all generating power plants serving the
system, not including low-cost / must run plants / units. It may be calculated:
•  Option B: Based on the total net electricity generation of all power plants serving the system and
the fuel types and total fuel consumption of the project electricity system.
The following data are available from the Turkish Electricity Transmission Company (TEİAŞ) web
•  Annual fuel consumption by fuel type19,
•  Annual heating values for fuels consumed for electricity generation20,
•  Annual electricity generation by fuel type, import and export21
Taking into consideration the available data Simple OM method Option B is the applicable
method for the project activity. Option A requires data on net electricity generation of each power
plant / unit and a CO  emission factor of each power unit, both of which are not publicly available,
for the Turkish electricity grid.
EF , using option B is calculated based on the net electricity supplied to the grid by all
power plants serving the system, not including low-cost / must-run power plants / units, and
based on the fuel type(s) and total fuel consumption of the project electricity system, as follows:
EF = Simple operating margin CO  emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh)
grid, OM simple,y  2 2
FC  = Amount of fossil fuel type i consumed in the project electricity system in year y (mass or
volume unit)
NCV  = Net calorific value (energy content) of fossil fuel type i in year y (GJ/mass or volume unit)

Step 5 - Calculate the build margin (BM) emission factor:
The tool indicates that, in terms of vintage of data, project participants can choose between one
of the following two options:
Option 1: For the first crediting period, calculate the build margin emission factor ex ante based
on the most recent information available on units already built for sample group m at the time of
CDM-PDD submission to the DOE for validation. For the second crediting period, the build margin
emission factor should be updated based on the most recent information available on units
already built at the time of submission of the request for renewal of the crediting period to the
DOE. For the third crediting period, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second
crediting period should be used. This option does not require monitoring the emission factor
during the crediting period.
And ,
Option 2: For the first crediting period, the build margin emission factor shall be updated
annually, ex post, including those units built up to the year of registration of the project activity or,
if information up to the year of registration is not yet available, including those units built up to the
latest year for which information is available. For the second crediting period, the build margin
emissions factor shall be calculated ex ante, as described in Option 1 above. For the third
crediting period, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second crediting period
should be used.
We prefer the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission factor, “ex ante”, for the first
crediting period.
The sample group of power units m used to calculate the build margin are determined as per the
following procedure, consistent with the data vintage selected above:
a)  Identify the set of five power units, excluding power units registered as CDM project activities,
that started to supply electricity to the grid most recently (SET ) and determine their annual
electricity generation (AEG , in MWh);
b)  Determine the annual electricity generation of the project electricity system; excluding power units
registered as CDM project activities (AEG , in MWh). Identify the set of power units, excluding
power units registered as CDM project activities, that started to supply electricity to the grid most
recently and that comprise 20% of AEG  (if 20% falls on part of the generation of a unit, the
generation of that unit is fully included in the calculation) (SET ) and determine their annual
electricity generation (AEG , in MWh);
5-units ≥20%
electricity generation (SET ); Identify the date when the power units in SET  started to
sample sample
supply electricity to the grid. If none of the power units in SET  started to supply electricity to
the grid more than 10 years ago, then use SET  to calculate the build margin.
According to the tool in terms of vintage of data, project participants can choose either the ex-
ante option or the ex-post option. Between these two options, Option 1 is selected. For the first
crediting period, the build margin emission factor is calculated ex-ante based on the most recent
information available on units already built for sample group m at the time of CDM-PDD
submission to the DOE for validation. For the second crediting period, the build margin emission
factor will be updated based on the most recent information available on units already built at the
time of submission of the request for renewal of the crediting period to the DOE. For the third
crediting period, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second crediting period will be
used. This option does not require monitoring the emission factor during the crediting period.
The build margin emissions factor is the generation-weighted average emission factor
(tCO /MWh) of all power units m during the most recent year y for which power generation data is
available, calculated as follows:
EF  = Build margin CO2 emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh)
grid,BM,y  2
EG       = Net quantity of electricity generated and delivered to the grid by power unit m
in year y (MWh)
EL,m,y   2 2
m      = Power units included in the build margin
y      = Most recent historical year for which electricity generation data is available
According to the tool, the CO emission factor of each power unit m (EF ) should be
2  EL,m,y
determined as per the guidance in step 4 (a) for the simple OM, using options A1, A2 or A3, using
for y the most recent historical year for which power generation data is available, and using for m
the power units included in the build margin. Taking into consideration the available data on the
capacity additions, the formula given under Option A2 of the Simple OM option A is used to
calculate EF .
The CO  emissions from the most recent capacity additions are calculated by multiplying the
EF  values calculated for each fuel source by the annual generation of that fuel source (Table
15). The emission factor has been taken as “zero” for the renewable and wastes and the
generation efficiencies for the thermal power plants type of which are not known are taken as
60% which is generation efficiency for the combined cycle natural gas power plants. The Build
Margin Emission Factor for each year is calculated by dividing the total CO  Emissions of the
subject year by the total generation from the capacity additions of the same year.
The Build Margin Emission Factor of the grid is then calculated as an average for the years 2010
and 2011, as explained in the part where the actual calculations are shown, the assessed
capacities added in these two years constitutes our SET
Step 6 - Calculation of the combined margin emissions factor
Finally, the combined margin grid emission factor (EF ) is expressed as the weighted
average of the Operating Margin emission factor (EF ) and the Build Margin emission factor
(EF ):
EF   Build margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh)

Although there will be an emergency/back up diesel generator installed within the project
boundary, the emissions from these have been deemed negligible as per the ACM0002 (version
14.0.0) methodology, since it will be solely utilized in case of an emergency, such as a power
In addition to this Although the methodology (ACM002, v.14.0.0) requires reservoir area to be
monitored, since the power density of the project activity is very large, and the area flooded due
to the project activity cannot exceed the above given amount (26,000 m2; See also Annex-5: The
Map Showing the Reservoir Area of the Project Activity on page 75), the parameter related to the
reservoir area is not going to be monitored during the crediting period for Midilli HPP Project.
3.3  Leakage
There are no leakage emissions related to project activity.
3.4  Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Ex-ante calculation of emission reductions:
Simple Operating margin (OM)
As also explained above, for the computation of the Simple OM, the Ex-Ante option is selected, at
the time of PD submission to the DOE, the data vintages that were most recent, belongs to the
years 2010, 2011 and 2012. All the data used in calculation of the Simple OM are taken from the
TEİAŞ website, details of which are given below. Taking into account the available data “Simple
OM” method “Option B” is the appropriate method for the project activity. TEİAŞ publishes the
annual heating values of the fuels consumed in the power plants, the heating values are directly
related to fuel consumption and are used to calculate average Net Calorific Values (TJ/kt) (Table
The heating values of fuels consumed in thermal power plants are announced by TEİAŞ, the unit
of the heating values are Tcal. Tcal is converted to GJoule by using the conversion factor 1cal =
4.1868 Joule. Then the heating values in GJ are divided by Fuel Consumption (FC ) to get the
Net Calorific Values of the fuels consumed in TJ/kt as follows:
Table 9: Net Calorific Values for each fuel type for Turkey
The emission factors of fuels required are taken from IPCC 2006 guidelines for GHG
inventories22. All data used for the calculations can be found in Annex-2 (See Table 1 and Table 2
in Annex -2). Table 10 shows total CO emission by fuel types calculated using lower IPCC
emission factors and available data from the TEİAŞ website.
Table 10: Calculation of emission by electricity generation (2010-2012)

National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, (http://www.ipcc-
Net electricity generated and supplied to the grid by thermal power plants has been calculated
using data obtained from TEİAŞ web page. The ratio between total gross and total net generation
(including low-cost/must run plants) has been calculated for each year. The same ratio is
assumed to be valid for all thermal plants and total net generation by the plants has been
calculated accordingly. Summing up total net generation with the imported electricity, total supply
excluding low cost / must run sources for each year is determined and given in Table 11.
Table 11: Net Electricity Generation from thermal power plants (units in GWh)
The OM Emission Factor for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are calculated by dividing the total
CO  emissions for those years (Table10) to the Net Electricity Generation (Table 12) for the
subject year. The annual OM emission factors are calculated as follows (Table 13):
Table 12: Annual OM Emission Factors
2010  0.65670
2011  0.66227
2012  0.72007
Finally, OM emission factor is calculated as a generation weighted average for the three most
recent years. The resulting OM Emission Factor is;
EF  =0.68084
Build Margin (BM)
As mentioned above we have preferred the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission
factor, “ex ante”, for the first crediting period.
The sample group of power units m used to calculate the build margin are determined as per the
following procedure, consistent with the data vintage selected above:
a)  Identify the set of five power units, excluding power units registered as CDM project activities
that started to supply electricity to the grid most recently (SET ) and determine their
annual electricity generation (AEG , in MWh);
b)  Determine the annual electricity generation of the project electricity system; excluding power
units registered as CDM project activities (AEG , in MWh). Identify the set of power units,
excluding power units registered as CDM project activities, that started to supply electricity to
the grid most recently and that comprise 20% of AEG  (if 20% falls on part of the
generation of a unit, the generation of that unit is fully included in the calculation) (SET )
and determine their annual electricity generation (AEG , in MWh);
5-units ≥20%
electricity generation (SET ); Identify the date when the power units in SET  started to
sample sample
supply electricity to the grid. If none of the power units in SET  started to supply electricity
to the grid more than 10 years ago, then use SET  to calculate the build margin.
From a source by the host country licencing body we have determined the commissioning dates
of the units in 2012. Accordingly  the amount of electricity produced by the newly added 5 units or
the SET are shown in the below table (Table 13):

The net electricity generation in year 2012 is taken as reference for determination of plants that
comprise 20% of the system generation.  Based on Turkey’s Annual Electricity statistics
published on the TEIAŞ web site (www.teias.gov.tr) , the net generation in year 2012 was
227,707.3 GWh (See Table 11, in 2012, out of this amount 13,629.40 GWh was identified24 to be

Projection report published by TEIAS (http://www.teias.gov.tr/KAPASITEPROJEKSIYONU2012.pdf). We have checked and
identified the units that have claimed VERs by comparing the list to the Gold Standard registry
(https://gs2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp?r=111) and VCS Project Database (http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org). This list is

Summing up the electricity generations of all the plants added to the Turkish National Grid in
2012, 2011, and adding up those power plant units added in 2010 between 7th of October to 31st

the total generation in this period (7 October 2010 to 31 December 2012) up to  46,608.08 GWh.
The total generation by the power plants added in year 2012 is  13,787.45 GWh. This number is
still smaller than the AEG value of 46,608.08 GWh. Therefore, to reach the AEG  all

we are using in our BM calculation reached up to 46,608.08 GWh and this number is greater than
the 20% of the total generation, So only the power plants added in the last 27 months, excluding
those claiming VER credits, are used in the calculations. As there is no power unit older than 10
years this number is being used for Build Margin Calculations.
The lists of most recent capacity additions to the grid by year and their average and firm
generation capacities for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are available as Annex-2 to the capacity
projection reports published in the TEIAS web page. Although the annual generation capacity
data for each plant is not available on the statistics page of TEİAŞ. The data for the years 201225,
201126 and 201027 are taken from the TEİAŞ Capacity Projection Reports which are also
available in another section of the TEİAŞ website. For the capacity additions, the firm generation
capacities of the power plants are used. The units that are taken out of the grid are not taken into
consideration. All the data used for calculations can be found in Annex-2 (see Table 8a and
According to the tool in terms of vintage of data, a project participant can choose either the ex-
ante option or the ex-post option. As explained above, out of these two options, Option 1 is
selected. For the first crediting period, the build margin emission factor is calculated ex-ante
based on the most recent information available on units already built for sample group m at the
time of CDM-PDD submission to the DOE for validation. For the second crediting period, the build
margin emission factor will be updated based on the most recent information available on units
already built at the time of submission of the request for renewal of the crediting period to the
DOE. For the third crediting period, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second
crediting period will be used. This option does not require monitoring the emission factor during

Electric efficiency rates
There is no complete and up-to-date data regarding the electrical efficiency of thermal power
plants that supply electricity to the Turkish National Grid system. Therefore the default values
provided in Annex 1(Default efficiency factors for power plants)  of the Methodological Tool to
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system (Version 04.0.0) (EB 75; Annex 15) is
utilised, in a very conservative manner, considering that we are unable to differentiate the units
that were commissioned before year 2000, and we cannot differentiate their technologies, all the
coal and lignite fired thermal power plants are considered to operate with 50% efficiency, all the
oil fired power plants are considered to operate with 46% efficiency, and all the Natural Gas fired
power plants are considered to operate at 60 % efficiency. For the diesel powered thermal power
plants the efficiency is considered to be 46%. Since the default values are not provided for
Naphtha, it is considered to behave like oil and its efficiency is considered as 46%, and Bitumen
is considered to behave like coal and its efficiency is considered to be 50%. The efficiency values
considered in BM calculations can be summarized as follows (Table 14):
Table 14: Default Electric efficiency rates taken from Annex 1 of the Methodological Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system (Version 04.0.0) (EB 75 Report Annex 15).
Fuel Type   Average Electric efficiency rate
Lignite  50.0%
Diesel  46.0%
Natural Gas  60.0%
The parameters for the calculation of EF , and its calculation is shown in Table 15 below:

Efficiency %  tCO /MWh
The CO  emissions from the most recent capacity additions are calculated by multiplying the
EF  values calculated for each fuel source by the annual generation of that fuel source (Table
16). The emission factor has been taken as “zero” for the renewable and wastes. The Build
Margin Emission Factor for each year is calculated by dividing the total CO  Emissions of the
subject year by the total generation from the capacity additions of the same year.
Table 16 Annual CO  Emissions for Capacity Additions and Annual BM Emission Factors
The Build Margin Emission Factor of the grid is then calculated as a generation weighted average
for the years 2010,2011 and 2012. The resulting BM Grid is:
EF  = 0.34716 tCO /MWh

33 PMUM/MFRC Piyasa Mali Uzlaştırma Merkezi / Market Financial Reconciliation Center.
4.3  Monitoring Plan
Objectives of the monitoring program
The Monitoring plan is developed to ensure that the Project Activity is well organized from the
start in terms of the collection and archiving of complete and reliable data that is needed to
ensure reliable and accurate measurements of actual emission reductions.
Data to be monitored
Given that the emission factor is calculated on an ex-ante basis, the first data to be monitored is
the electricity net supplied to the grid.
The second data to be monitored is the installed capacity of the Project Activity. Using the
SCADA system installed capacity will be measured automatically.
Monitoring procedures
The monitoring will be conducted by the Verified Emission Reduction (VER) Monitoring Team.
The VER Team Members, and their position and duties for the monitoring is outlined in the
following table (Table 18):
Table 18: Positions and responsibilities of the VER monitoring team members.
34 The latest version of the communiqué (in Turkish) can be found in the following link: http://www.epdk.gov.tr/web/elektrik-piyasasi-
The power imported from the grid and exported to the grid is recorded continously via two
bidirectional meters located at Yenidere Transformation Station that belongs to the Grid operator
The total electricity import and the total electricity export of the project activity is measured via two
meters that measure the generation over two feeders that carry electricity from the power house
to the Yenidere Transformation station via a short cable. The data is measured continously and
recorded on an hourly basis to the PMUM/MFRC servers.
Data can be accessed remotely via the Automated Meter Reading Software installed to the
project owners computers, but is continously recorded to the PMUM/MFRC servers.
Each month the internal and external consumption recorded hourly by the meters are extracted
and saved onto excel spread sheets, for each meter..
Data used for the calculation of EG EG parameters are the summation of
PP-self consumption, y  PP-gross, y
the outputs provided via two meters, Midilli Ana-1 and Midilli Ana-2.  The PMUM/MFRC servers
automatically calculate the overall grid loss of the country and reflect it in the monthly meter
reading outputs of each meter, along side with the direct meter readings. The amount indicated
with loss are not used in the emission reduction calculations as the loss calculated by the grid
operator is beyond the project boundary.
Monitoring equipment
Electricity meters
The main and back-up electricity meter will be bi-directional for quantifying the electricity
delivered by the Project Activity to the grid.
The meters will be in compliance with the standards of the Turkish Standards Institute and will
have obtained a “Type and System Approval” certificate from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
In case there are modifications to the standards, the modified standard shall be valid; and in case
a valid standard is cancelled or abolished, the new standard shall be valid. The standards that will
be used are TS-620 EN 60044-1 and TS718 IEC60044.2 for main and back-up meters,
respectively. The sensitivity of the main and secondary meters are CI = 0.5S for active and
reactive energy. The meters shall be factory calibrated by the manufacturer before installation.
Records of the meter (type, made, model and calibration documentation) will be retained in the
quality control system.
Data collecting and recording
I. The net electricity generation by the project activity. Based on the baseline scenario presented
above, this amount of electricity would have been produced by the Turkish National Grid.
The electricity produced will be sold to TEİAŞ. Therefore, TEİAŞ measures the electricity
produced as the summation of two main meters and two Back-up meters:
a.  Main Electricity Meter-1: ELSTER A1500 SL761: -Serial Number: 464220
b.  Main Electricity Meter-2: ELSTER A1500 SL761: -Serial Number: 464222
c.  Back-up Electricity Meter-2: ELSTER A1500 SL761: -Serial Number: 464221
d.  Back-up Electricity Meter-2: ELSTER A1500 SL761: -Serial Number: 464223
These meters are placed at the TEIAŞ Yenidere TM (Transformer Station). The Summation of the
data recorded by the Main meter 1 and 2 will provide official data which will be remotely read
remotely and recorded continously to the PMUM/MFRC serves for invoicing. TEİAŞ also
conducts the calibration and maintenance of these meters and thus, ensures the accuracy and
quality of the measurements. The quality standards that the meters need to comply is “The
ICE/TSE 62053-22: Electricity metering equipment (a.c) – Particular requirements - Part 22:
Static meters for active energy (Classes 0,2 S and 0,5 S)” The calibration of the meters are done
and the meters will be checked continuously if there is a difference of ±0.5 % in the readings of
the main and the back-up meters, the calibration is repeated.
At the end of each month, the monthly generation will be accessed remotely via the
PMUM/MFRC web site by the Project owners account manager to determine the invoiced
generation amount. In case of failure of any of the main meters, their relevant control meters are
used to determine the invoiced generation amount.
The net electricity produced (EG ) in year y is calculated by subtracting the total electricity
PP-net, y
consumed by the hydroelectric power plant (EG ) , from the gross electricity
PP-self consumption, y
generation (EG ) . After obtaining the net electricity production value, the emission
PP-gross, y
reductions will be calculated by multiplying the net electricity with the Ex-ante Combined Margin
Emission Factor calculated above.
Measuring Installed Capacity
By means of the SCADA system established in the plant all kinds of technical parameters related
with turbines and generators including installed capacity will be measured and stored in the
system on real time basis. The installed capacity of the plant will be measured from SCADA once
a year while the plant is operated with full load and the related data will be stored as per the
monitoring program.
Data management
At the end of each month, electricity supplied to the grid will be transferred into an electronic
spread sheet titled raw data, so that it can be processed for verified emission reduction
calculations.  The data to be measured for installed capacity will be entered into an electronic
spread sheet at the end of each year. The electronic files will be backed up on both hard drives
and on a Compact Discs (CD).
Quality Control and Assurance (QC/QA)
All of the main and back-up meters located at Yenidere TM (Transformation Station) are owned
and installed by the grid operator, TEIAS. The Project Owner has signed an agreement with the
grid operator to specify the QA procedure for measurement and calibration to ensure the
measurement accuracy of the main and back-up meters are in compliance with national
regulations. The Calibrations of the electricity meters are valid for the next 10 years after
The grid operator's Metering Officer should be notified of any failure of one of the meters. TEIAS
is the only one entity, authorized to deal with fixing, calibrating, or changing the meters, which will
be done either by the grid operator or by a company authorized by the grid operator. The Project
Owner will keep electricity export and import records via the meters that are located at the
powerhouse, to which the recorded data will be compared.
All written documentation such as maps, drawings, the EIA and the Feasibility study, will be
stored and will be made available to the verifier so that the reliability of the information may be
All the data and documentation related to the verification will be archived for minimum two years
after the end of the first crediting period.
5  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
In accordance with “Environmental Law” No. 2872 (Issued in 1983), Annex 2 of Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation (issued in 1993 and revised in 2001), run-of-river type HPPs
with an installed capacity of 50 MW or less are not subject to  full EIA investigation or report
preparation. Instead, for these types of projects, a preliminary EIA report including general
information about the project site and general project characteristics was submitted to local
Branch of The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (Later the tittle of the ministry changed as
Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning). At the end of the review of the report, the Ministry
issued a certificate stating that “there is no need for an EIA report”.
Some possible environmental impacts during construction and operating phases stated in the
preliminary EIA are summarized in the following:
Other hazardous waste materials such as used tires, used batteries, cables, paint, barrels, oil
contaminated soil, oil preserving filters, etc., will be piled in a designated are on site temporarily in
accordance with Control of Hazardous Waste Directive which was published in the Official
Gazette dated March 14th, 2005 and numbered 25755 and will ultimately be transported to the
nearest hazardous waste recycling or discharge plants.
As there was no settlement in the reservoir area, resettlement was not needed for the Project
6  STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS
Since the project activity was less than 50 MW, the host country regulations didn’t request the
project activity to perform a full EIA. Therefore there was not a stake holder consultation meeting
held within the framework of an SEIA. However, in order to explain the issues related to the
project and especially in order to inform the land owners about the expropriation process the
Energy Market Regulatory Agency have organized a stake holder’s consultation meeting.
When we have visited the site to collect information for the Social Carbon Standard Point Zero
Report, we have contacted the village heads (muhtars) of the nearby settlements and we have
talked with the local government officers who are in charge of the issues like environmental
To be able to confirm the occurrence of the mentioned EMRA organized, expropriation related
stake holder consultation meeting, we asked about this to the Muhtar’s. Mr Muharrem Kelce, the
Muhtar of the Kızılkışlacık village, explained us that there really occurred one such meeting to
explain the project’s aspects and the expropriation process that would effect their lands.
In our visits to the local representation of the Ministry of the Environment and Urban Planning we
asked about any possible environmental disturbance the project activity could have cause, during
construction and operation stages of the project. It is revealed in our conversations that during the
construction period there were some issues related to dusting, but this problem is not existing at
the time of this version of the PDD as the project activity is now operational.
More information about the acceptance of the project and relationship between the project
management and local stakeholders can be found in the Point Zero Social Carbon Report
prepared for the project activity.
In general we have observed that there has been some issues raised by the stakeholders during
the construction phase of the project, and local inhabitants attributed  these issues mainly to the
attitudes former owners of the project activity. The government official were happy with the project
as the project was in compliance with the host country regulations (See Annex 1).
Both the muhtars that we have interviewed about the project activity and the local government
offices also noted that the communication between the Midilli HPP management and the local
inhabitants were based on an ad hoc relationship, where the local inhabitants were always
welcome to visit, and that they were able to reach the project activity management via cell phone,
any time they needed.
